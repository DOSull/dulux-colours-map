# A web map from the Dulux colours of New Zealand
This is just a demonstration of the flexibility of the R ecosystem for quickly putting together a [web map](map).

The [map](map) is a somewhat silly take on this [range of paints](https://www.dulux.co.nz/colour/colours-of-new-zealand).

The R code used to make the map can be viewed [here](code/build-dulux-colours-map.md).

The annotated output from the [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) of [the code](code/build-dulux-colours-map.Rmd?raw=true) can be [viewed here](markdown-output).
